      <ul>
        <li>fresh chorizo</li>
        <li>poblano pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt/pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>shredded cheese</li>

    <strong>1.</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo, poblano pepper, onions, and red bell pepper. 
    Cook until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>2.</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, cook potatoes with a small amount of water until fork tender, 7 to 10 minutes, 
stirring halfway through; drain. Stir potatoes into chorizo mixture. Meanwhile, whisk eggs, half-and-half, salt, 
and pepper together in a large bowl.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>3.</strong> Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add egg mixture and scramble until eggs are cooked, about 3 minutes. 
Remove eggs from heat. Fold in cheese. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.</strong> Spoon chorizo mixture in a line across the middle of a tortilla, then add a layer of scrambled eggs. 
Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling 
creating a burrito.
