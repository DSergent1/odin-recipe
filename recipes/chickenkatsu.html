        <h3>Panko breaded chicken with sauce</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for deep-fat frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness</li>
            <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>

            <li>For the sauce, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and soy sauce, and 
                a pinch of pepper. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

            </li>
            <li>Place flour and panko bread crumbs onto separate plates and season with salt and pepper. 
                Place the beaten egg in a medium bowl. Dip flattened chicken pieces first into flour, 
                then egg, and lastly bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>Fry breaded chicken breasts in preheated oil until golden brown and no longer pink in center, 
                about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. 
                Slice chicken into thin strips and top with a drizzle of sauce and a sprinkling of sliced green onions. 
                Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.
            </li>
        </ol>
